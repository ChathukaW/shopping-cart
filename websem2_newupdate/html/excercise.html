    If you love the benefits of a cardio workout, swimming may be your ideal match.<br><br>

The water keeps you cool, even as your heart gets a great workout. You ll probably be able to keep yourself going for a longer time than if you were running. That s because it s fun and gentle on your joints and muscles. The water can also feel relaxing.<br><br>

Plan on doing 2 1/2 hours of swimming a week. Or mix in swimming with other cardio workouts. You can set your own pace, going as fast as you like.
<br><br>
Most people swim laps in a pool. If you swim in an ocean or lake, make sure you know how to stay safe in open water with currents.
<br><br>
If you don t already know how to swim, there are classes at community pools, gyms, and YMCAs or YWCAs. It s good to know how to swim, for safety s sake, even if you aren t planning to make swimming your main workout.<br>

    It's been shown to increase strength, flexibility, and VO2 consumption. But more than that, it's got mental and spiritual benefits you may not be able to get from other workouts.<br><br>

Plus, there are several types of yoga worth trying. Bikram yoga keeps the room heated to 105 F, power or vinyasa yoga amp up the intensity, and restorative or hatha yoga classes may focus more on breathing and meditation. All of these styles can be challengingâ€”helping you to break a sweat in no time.<br><br>
