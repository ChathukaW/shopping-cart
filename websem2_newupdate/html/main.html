            <p> A nutritious, well-balanced diet – along with physical activity and refraining from smoking – is the foundation of good health. Healthy eating includes consuming high-quality proteins, carbohydrates, heart-healthy fats, vitamins, minerals and water in the foods you take in while minimizing processed foods, saturated fats and alcohol.<br> Eating in this manner helps you maintain your body’s everyday functions, promotes optimal body weight and can assist in disease prevention. </p>

            <p>  You probably don't realize it, but your skin is constantly reinventing itself: The outer layer regenerates every month.<br>
                Your body's biggest organ needs to stay in tip-top shape because it has important jobs to do—like shielding you from pathogens,
                the elements, and everyday bumps and falls. You can help by giving your skin the TLC it deserves. <br>
                That means eating the right nutrients, slathering on sunscreen, and checking for suspicious spots, says Jessica Wu, MD, 
                professor of dermatology at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine. <br>
                Bonus: Those same healthy habits will keep your skin soft, smooth and gorgeous, too. </p>

            <p> Our bodies are seriously smart. After only a few weeks of repeating the same exercise routine, the body will acclimate and adjust by figuring out how to use less energy and calories to accomplish the same thing.<br> This means you’re working just as hard as you were before but burning less fat.<br> You don’t have to work out MORE, necessarily, but you do have to workout SMARTER by always keeping your muscles guessing. </p>

            <p> A good work-life balance can be hard to attain, and you probably know that conflicts between your job and personal life can damage your physical and mental health.<br> But a new study suggests that dwelling on these conflicts—and thinking about them over and over again—can make things even worse.</p>

            <p> Between long hours at work, weekend chores, dinner plans with friends, and time for your family, your calendar is overflowing.<br>But can you remember the last time you took an hour, maybe even two, for yourself?<br> If you had to think longer than a few seconds, you may want to consider taking a step back and reevaluating your schedule.<br> Prioritizing everyone else in your life may seem honorable, but the reality is, totally neglecting yourself isn’t good for anyone.<br> </p>

                <br>
                The good news is that some simple, everyday habits can make a big difference in your ability to live a healthy lifestyle.</p>

            <p> How well you snooze at night has a lot to do with how you spend your days—sleep quality has been linked with everything from diet and exercise to electronic screen use.<br> Now, a new study suggests that something a little less tangible may play a role, as well: <br>People who have a strong purpose in life tend to sleep better through the night, with fewer symptoms of sleep apnea and restless legs.</p>
